          Hi, I'm Winsome Yuen the artist behind ArtisticTail. I am a self-taught artist who is 
          passionate about creating unique and inspiring dog artworks using rich blacks. Photography
          with digital editing is my main medium, but I also enjoy creating sculptures and drawings.
          I am currently pursuing a MA in History of Art with Curation at Birkbeck, University of London.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My art is inspired by the simplicity of focusing on a singular colour to create subtle contrast 
          to highlight the subject. Experimenting with different textures and materials is also a big part 
          of my art. I am passionate about the history of art surrounding the subject of dogs, and I'm an
          advocate for the protection of dogs. I hope my art can bring joy and inspiration.
